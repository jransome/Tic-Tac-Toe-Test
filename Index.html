    <p>
      Welcome to Tic Tac Toe!
      To interact with the program open the browser console (Chrome: Cmd + Alt + j on Mac, Ctrl + Shift +j on Windows), and use the following commands:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li> Create a new game instance with `var game = new Game()`. </li>
      <li> Play a turn (cross is first by default) with `game.playTurn(row, column)`, where row and column are zero indexed and (0, 0) is the top-left of the board. </li>
      <li> Executing `playTurn()` alternates between cross' and nought's turn, hence running it again will play nought's turn.</li>
      <li> If you try to place a marker where one already exists an exception will be thrown. </li>
      <li> If a game is over (by win or draw), `playTurn()` will throw an exception.</li>
    </ul>
